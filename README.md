SGE-Core: The Sovereign Gateway Extension (v1.0)

Status: PATENT PENDING (UK Application No. GB2602979.3) Filing Date: 09 February 2026

Org: @safe-haven

Web-Native Key Precipitation: Abolishing Stored Credentials

SGE-Core is the reference implementation of the Sovereign Access Constant ($C_{sa}$) for web environments. It replaces the "Credential Honey-Pot" with a Resonance Handshake, ensuring that access keys only exist in volatile RAM during the moment of authentication.

1. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NOTICE

The methods for Multi-Substrate Zero-Knowledge Authentication and Presence-Gated Data Access utilized in this gateway are protected under UK Patent Application No. GB2602979.3.

By utilizing this repository, you acknowledge the Safe Haven Foundation as the Architect of the Standard and agree to the mandatory ethical clauses of the Safe Haven Ethical License (SHEL) v1.0.

2. THE DUAL-LAYER SHIELD

The WASM Core: Executes the mathematical $f$-function in a hardened, isolated WebAssembly memory space. The Ghost Key precipitates in volatile RAM and is zeroized within 10ms of use.

The Native Bridge: Communicates with local hardware (TPM 2.0 / Secure Enclave) to verify silicon resonance ($\omega$) without ever exposing raw hardware IDs to the web substrate.

3. STRATEGIC UTILITY

For Enterprises: Eliminate the liability of user password databases. If you don't store it, they can't steal it.

For Users: Total privacy. Site-specific resonance vectors make cross-site tracking mathematically impossible.

For Manufacturers: Direct kernel-to-web integration of hardware identity.

4. NPM INTEGRATION

The SGE-Core standard is distributed via the @safe-haven scoped package:

npm install @safe-haven/sge-core


Invitation to the Haven

We are seeking security architects and hardware partners to pilot the Sovereign Gateway for high-stakes environments (Healthcare, Legal, Finance).
